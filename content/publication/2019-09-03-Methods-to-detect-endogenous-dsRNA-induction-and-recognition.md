abstract = "Nucleic acid sensing is a central mechanism for innate immune defense against foreign molecules that culminates with an activation of interferon signaling pathways. This involves detection of molecular patterns associated with extracellular or intracellular pathogens by specialized receptors within the cell. In addition to foreign molecules, cells also sense endogenous molecules. One specific arm of nucleic acid sensors detects dsRNA structures. In this chapter, we discuss principles of dsRNA recognition and downstream activation of signaling pathways important in the process of antiviral responses. We also discuss various mechanisms by which endogenous dsRNA can form in a cell, in particular, through epigenetic regulation. Finally, we provide approaches for measuring and quantifying dsRNA accumulation and downstream activation in human colorectal cancer cells."
